		<h2>About My Cat Mauricio</h2>
	
			<p>Mauricio and I go way back.  I found him living behind some garbage cans in El Paso, Texas about ten years ago.  I lured him out from his hideaway with some sardines.  He hopped in the car and our life together began.</p>
		
			<p>Mauricio loves nothing more than to hide and to snuggle. In the image below, you'll see him tucked up in one of his favorite places, a brown paper bag!</p>

		<h2>Hortence, Mauricio's Best Bud</h2>

			<p>Mauricio has a dear friend named Hortence who likes to come over for tea and fish. Hortence does not share Mauricio's love of hiding in bags. She likes to say she is more of an extrovert, and she has allowed me to share this image of her in the park, where she likes to lead other cats in lively discussions about dogs, birds, and yarn.</p>
